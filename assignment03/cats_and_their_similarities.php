            <h2>Similarities</h2>
            <p>I have decided to include three different animals belonging to the subfamily Felinae. These species were chosen because they are genetically similar, but are considered very different animals in common opinion. Additionally, these are the cutest cat-like species that I could find. F. catus is the common domesticated cat, L. pardinus is the Iberian Lynx, and P. concolor is a cougar. Although they are all related, they live in different habitats and live very different lives. </p>

                <h2>Felus catus - Common Cat</h2>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[2][1] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.[4] The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>

                    <h3>Survival</h3>
                        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                        <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.[8] Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.[9]</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated since around 3100 BC.[10][11] However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in Cyprus, where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC.[12] African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East.[13] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[14][15]</p>
                    <h3>Impact on Humans</h3>
                        <p>As of 2007, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish.[16] As of 2010, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.[17]</p>

                <h2>Puma concolor - Cougar</h2>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America,[4] and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur.[5][6][7][8] The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae,[1][9][10] of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Survival</h3>
                        <p>The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates, particularly deer. It also hunts species as small as insects and rodents. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is territorial and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the apex predator in its range, yielding to the jaguar, gray wolf, American black bear, and grizzly bear. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but have recently been increasing in North America as more people enter cougar territories.[11]</p>
                    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                        <p>Only females are involved in parenting. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own.[68] Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.[47] Newborn cougars have spots that fade and eventually disappear by the age of 2 1/2 years.[72] Juveniles remain with their mothers at least for two years.[73]</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>Intensive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the North American cougar was extirpated in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for the isolated Florida panther subpopulation.</p>
                    <h3>Impact on Humans</h3>
                        <p>Transient males have been verified in Minnesota,[12] Missouri,[13] Iowa,[14][15] Michigan, Indiana,[16] and Illinois (where a cougar was shot in the city limits of Chicago),[17][18][16] and in at least one instance, observed as far east as coastal Connecticut.[19][20] Reports of eastern cougars (P. c. cougar) still surface, although it was declared extirpated in 2011.[21]</p>

                <h2>Lynx pardinus - Iberian Lynx</h2>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild cat species native to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe that is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[1] It preys almost exclusively on the European rabbit.[2] In the 20th century, the Iberian lynx population declined because of sharp declines in rabbit populations, caused by myxomatosis, rabbit haemorrhagic disease and overhunting, fragmentation of grassland and forest habitats and poaching.[3]</p>

                    <h3>Survival</h3>
                        <p>The Iberian lynx preys foremost on the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) for the bulk of its diet, supplemented by red-legged partridge, rodents and to a smaller degree also on wild ungulates.[14][15][16] It sometimes preys on young fallow deer, roe deer, mouflon, and ducks.[17] A male requires one rabbit per day while a female raising kittens will eat three per day.[18] The Iberian species has low adaptability—it continued to rely heavily on rabbits (75% of its food intake) despite the latter's repeated population crashes due to two diseases: myxomatosis, which spread to Iberia after a physician intentionally introduced it in France in 1952, and rabbit haemorrhagic disease beginning in 1988.[3] There were two major outbreaks of the latter in 2011 and 2012.[19] Recovery has occurred in some areas—in 2013, rabbit overpopulation was reported south of Córdoba, causing damage to transport infrastructure and farms.[20] In December 2013, however, it was reported that wildlife officials were concerned about the spread of a new strain of the hemorraghic disease, affecting mainly young rabbits.[21][22] Sierra Morena's rabbit population was worst affected, falling from an average of three per hectare to less than one—below the minimum required level of 1.5 to two per hectare.[23] Forced to travel greater distances for food, the lynx became more susceptible to death in road accidents, particularly on Autovía A-4.[23]</p>
                    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                        <p>During the mating season the female leaves her territory in search of a male. The typical gestation period is about two months; the kittens are born between March and September, with a peak of births in March and April. A litter consists of two or three (rarely one, four or five) kittens weighing between 200 and 250 grams (7.1 and 8.8 oz). The kittens become independent at 7 to 10 months old, but remain with the mother until around 20 months old. Survival of the young depends heavily on the availability of prey species. In the wild, both males and females reach sexual maturity at the age of one year, though in practice they rarely breed until a territory becomes vacant; one female was known not to breed until five years old when its mother died. The maximum longevity in the wild is 13 years.[25][26]</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>Formerly considered a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), the Iberian lynx is now classified as a separate species. Both species occurred together in Central Europe in the Pleistocene and evolved as distinct species in the Late Pleistocene.[6] The Iberian lynx is thought to have evolved from Lynx issiodorensis.[7]</p>
                    <h3>Impact on Humans</h3>
                        <p>By the turn of the 21st century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only about 100 individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in Andalusia. Conservation measures implemented since 2002 included improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, translocating and re-introducing Iberian lynxes, so that by 2012 the population had increased to 326 individuals.[4] As an attempt to save this species from extinction, projects under the EU LIFE Programme have undertaken habitat preservation, lynx population monitoring, and rabbit population management.[5]</p>
