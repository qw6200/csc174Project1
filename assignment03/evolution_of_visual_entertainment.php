            <h2>Similarities</h2>
            <p>Theatre, Cinema and Television are forms of visual entertainment were the audience watches a show or a performance.
                They are different medias through which a story can be narrated and represented. The story or show is acted by
                professional actors, who generally have to follow a script and wear specific costumes or dresses.</p>
            <p>Each form of entertainment makes use of techonology to enhance the visual represesentations. Cinema and Television
                make the most use of technology such as CGI and Special Effect. However, Theatre too can incorporate modern
                technologies such as projectors and digital screens to astonish and further immerse the audience in the narration.

                <h2>Theatre - Since 600 BCE</h2>
                    <h3>The origins</h3>
                        <p>The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle, the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in
                        the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable
                        of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building
                        area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors
                        were only always men and wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Modern Day</h3>
                        <p>Twentieth-century theatre describes a period of great change within the theatrical culture of the 20th century,
                            mainly in Europe and North America. There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding
                            theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including modernism,
                            Expressionism, Impressionism, political theatre and other forms of Experimental theatre, as well as the continuing
                            development of already established theatrical forms like naturalism and realism.

                <h2>Cinema - Since 1895</h2>
                    <h3>The origins</h3>
                        <p>The commercial public screening of ten of Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as
                        the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and
                        screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a
                        worldwide success.
                        Soon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving
                        from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.
                        The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Modern Day</h3>
                        <p>The decade of the 2000s in film involved many significant developments in the film industries around the world,
                        especially in the technology used. Building on developments in the 1990s, computers were used to create effects that
                        would have previously been more expensive, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in Cast Away (leaving Tom
                        Hanks' character stranded with no other land in sight) to the vast battle scenes such as those in Gladiator, The Lord of
                        the Rings trilogy, The Matrix Reloaded, and 300.
                        Also gaining popularity was the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to produce films. These types of films were
                        originally seen in the 1990s with the likes of Toy Story, and Antz.

                <h2>Television -  Since 1920</h2>
                    <h3>The origins</h3>
                        <p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before
                            the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV
                            broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes,
                            businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In
                            the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Modern Day</h3>
                        <p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in
                            contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Due to data compression
                            digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that
                            represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Digital
                            TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not
                            until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.
