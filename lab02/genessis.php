			<p>I am a student majoring in Business, with a concentration in Analytics, and minoring in Computer Science and Spanish. Before coming to the University of Rochester, I attended Canyon High School in California where I was involved in various extracurricular such as: Student Government, National Honor Society, English National Honor Society, Spirit Club, Chemistry Club, and a few others. I even founded a chapter of the Science National Honor Society at my school and at the time I believed I wanted to major in Chemistry. </p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>I am a native to Los Angeles, California. I do not really know why I thought coming to school in New York would be a good idea but it somehow ended up happening because I think I thought I could handle the snow. I am now fed up with the snow but I do love the University of Rochester and do believe that I ended up where I was meant to. I originally came to UR, I planned to double major in Business and Computer Science and minor in Political Science but after taking a few classes and finding out what I really enjoyed, I decided to major in Business and move Computer Science to a minor and pick up a Spanish minor.</p>

			<h2>Highschool</h2>
			<p>Since starting college, I have held 3 jobs during the academic term. My first ever job at UR was at the Common Market where I worked for about a year and a half before deciding that I wanted a change. I applied to the Greene Center where I now work as a Front Desk/Administrative Assistant. I really enjoy working at the Greene Center because I am not only able to help people discover resources available to them on campus, but I also am able to develop my professional skills throughout this role. I also am currently working on a startup called BarterOut, which is a textbook exchange platform for students by students, as a Marketing Analyst. </p>

			<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
			<p>Upon arriving to UR, I also got involved in extracurricular activities. My freshman year, I got involved with Students’ Association (SA) and served on the Administration & Review Committee (ARC) as a Student Analyst, rushed Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi) (a business professional co-ed fraternity) and became Vice President of Alumni Relations, a general member on the Student Programming Board, and a general member of Gamma Phi Beta (GPB) (a social sorority). Moving into my sophomore year, I was elected to the 2020 Class Council and served as a Programming Chair, continued to serve as Vice President of Alumni Relations for AKPsi, was appointed Deputy Chair of ARC, served as Corresponding Secretary for GPB, and I also was a D’Lion. I am currently in my junior year where I am now Vice President of 2020 Class Council, dual as Chairwoman of Collegiate & Alumni Relations and Chairwoman of Community Service for GPB, continue to serve as a Student Analyst for ARC, a second year D’Lion, and Social Chair for Alpha Kappa Psi. I plan to remain actively involved in all of my extracurricular activities throughout the remainder of my college experience as I have learned many important and valuable experiences through them.</p>
