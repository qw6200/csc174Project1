# CSS Decision Explanations

#### Please only look at the lab02 of the repository, as the assignment3 is irrelevant and not touched.

## Typography
 * I used Merriweather and Playfair Display because they paired elegantly together to exhibit a feel of sleekness and neatness.

## Readability
 * I emphasized the sections (articles) by putting borders around them with a color that matches the background color. I chose the light blue color because it provides a very legible contrast with the black font color.

## Other Slight CSS Changes
 * I rotated the name back so that it is 180 degrees as I felt that it should match the orientation of all the other headings in the page. I also adjusted a bit of padding for the bottom of the nav and footer in order to improve organizational structure. I also unitalicized the aside because I felt that there wasn't a point in italicizing it, as it was already obvious that they were a more important part of Giovanni's page.
